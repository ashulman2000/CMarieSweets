                <div class="testimoniesstitch">“My husband loved his carrot cake birthday cake. Very creative and cake was exactly what we described and had envisioned. The red velvet flavor was delicious and very moist. We will be using them for all of our special occasion cakes. Highly recommend them, their cupcakes give sprinkles a run for their money!"
                    <br>
                    <br> "The black forest cupcakes I ordered for my husband's birthday were a huge hit! The cupcakes were seriously fantastic. I am not a frosting lover, but your frosting was light and so delicious! the cherry bits were a tasty addition!"
                    <br>
                    <br> “My wedding and grooms cakes were just what we wanted and were delicious too!! They made the process easy at tasting and were able to create awesome cakes from our ideas! Highly recommended!”
                    <br>
                    <br> “Everyone is still asking where we got our half Texas Turtle half Amaretto Almond wedding cake from. Christine did a superb job on our half Groom half Brides cake. She totally got the concept of what we wanted and nailed it. As a matter of fact she knocked it out the park!!! Delicious”
                    <br>
                    <br> “Christine is SO talented!! She absolutely loves what she does too! She made my vision come to life and it was far more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Both the wedding cake and the groom's cake were absolutely amazing! They were exactly what we wanted and the best part?? They were DELICIOUS!! I'm not talking delicious for a wedding cake... I'm talking the best cake you have EVER tasted! She does free taste testings if you wanna find out for yourself. :)”
                    <br>
                    <br> “I will recommend C. Marie Sweets to everyone! Christine is such a nice person with amazing talent! To me picking out the wedding cake was the most stressful part, I couldn't make up my mind, I didn't want over the top with over the top price, but I didn't want just plain. I was a very difficult person, I will be the first to admit it, but Christine helped me all the way through it. I sent her many different emails with cake ideas, she would respond back quickly and answer any questions that I had. The Groom's cake was amazing and beautiful, that was also difficult to pick out! She is the only vendor that did not make me nervous before the wedding. I appreciate all of her hard work, great response time and amazing talent! The cakes were beautiful and delicious! We received so many compliments!
                    <br>
                    <br> Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!”
